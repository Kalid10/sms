                The flagging feature for teachers serves as an intuitive
                mechanism for highlighting particular students for a variety of
                reasons. By "flagging" a student, teachers effectively mark that
                student's profile with a note or symbol, indicating that they
                require special attention or have achieved exceptional
                performance.

                Flags can represent a range of scenarios. For instance, a flag
                can signal academic struggles, requiring additional assistance
                in certain subjects, or it may indicate a student's exceptional
                performance that calls for more challenging work. Flags can also
                highlight attendance issues, behavioral concerns, or other
                specific circumstances.

                Once a teacher applies a flag to a student, it stays visible on
                their profile, making it straightforward for the educator to
                track the student's status and progress. This system aids
                teachers in adapting their teaching strategies according to each
                student's distinct requirements and performance levels.
            </p>

                In essence, the flagging feature cultivates an environment that
                supports individualized learning and progress, ensuring that
                every student's needs are recognized and addressed. By employing
                flags, teachers can help students overcome their challenges,
                boost their achievements, and ultimately, enable them to realize
                their full potential.
